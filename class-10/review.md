# Review

- Can you identify valid javascript code?
  - proper syntax
  - look at the file extension
  - inspector tool
  - you could run the code
  - GoogleFu that Q!
- Do you understand how if/else statements work?
  - reading assignments
  - checks the if statement if the condition returns true or false
    - it will either run the code block of code under it or jump to the else

    ```javascript
    if (condition) {
      this block will run if true;
    } else {
      this block will run if false;
    }
    ```

- Can you identify a valid JS function and call it?
  - parens to call/invoke it
    - ex: `nameOfFuntion();`
  - the keyword `function` tells JS that we are defining a function
  - it needs a code block
  - proper syntax & camelCase
  - run the function in repl.it

- Can you count how many loops a for loop should run?
  - check wether it's `<=` or `<`
  - check out the incrementor and decide how many loops it jumps at each iteration
  - check to see where your initial variable is starting at

  ```javascript
    for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
      this code will run as long as the conditional is true;
    }
  ```

- Can you figure out what a specfic operator is doing?
